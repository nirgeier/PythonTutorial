    number2 = int(1)
    print(number1,number2);
```

#### Floats
```python
    ## Floats
    number1 = 1.2
    number2 = float(1.2)
    print(number1,number2);
```

#### Complex
```python
    ## Complex (rare - not common used)
    # Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
    number1 = 1+2j
    print(number1);

    # output will be: 
    >>> number1 = 1+2j
    >>> print(number1)
    (1+2j)

```
